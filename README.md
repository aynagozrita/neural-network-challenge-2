Data Description
The dataset contains various features related to employee demographics, job roles, performance metrics, and attrition status. Key attributes include:
  • EmployeeID: Unique identifier for each employee.
  • Department: The department in which the employee works.
  • Attrition: Indicates whether the employee has left the company (Yes/No).
  • Additional features (e.g., age, salary, job satisfaction, etc.)
  
Model Evaluation
The model's performance metrics include:
  • Department Accuracy: 0.83
  • Attrition Accuracy: 0.64
While overall accuracy provides some insights, metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score would offer a more comprehensive evaluation, particularly for imbalanced datasets.

Results
  • The model demonstrated a department accuracy of approximately 83%, indicating that it effectively classifies departments.
  • The attrition accuracy of around 64% suggests room for improvement, particularly in identifying employees who are likely to leave the organization.
  
Improvement Suggestions
To enhance model performance, consider the following strategies:
  • Data Preprocessing: Improve data handling, including normalization and encoding.
  • Class Imbalance Handling: Implement techniques to address any class imbalances in the dataset.
  • Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different hyperparameters for better model performance.
  • Model Architecture Adjustments: Test various architectures or algorithms to optimize results.
  • Ensemble Techniques: Combine multiple models for more robust predictions.
